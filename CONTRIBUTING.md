# Contributing guidelines

These are guidelines for contributing to the PHPUnit documentation. Before submitting a new Issue or opening a new Pull Request, please search to see if already exists.


## Bug report

You can [submit an issue](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation/issues) describing the problem you found. Please, specify the version number and URL of the problem.

## Fixing an issue

The steps here may change in the future, but currently if you wish to contribute to the PHPUnit documentation, follow the following steps:

1. Fork the [PHPUnit Repository](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation).
2. Clone your fork to your local environment.
3. Create a new branch and checkout to it.
4. The documentation files exist as XML files inside the `src/` directory, organized by version and locale, e.g. `src/5.2/en/`. The last URL segment from [https://phpunit.de/manual/](https://phpunit.de/manual/) corresponds to the XML file basename, e.g. the `https://phpunit.de/manual/4.8/en/organizing-tests.html` page is generated by the `src/4.8/en/organizing-tests.xml` file.  When making an edit to an existing page, make the changes to all versions that applies. For example, if you wish to improve the `organizing-tests.xml` file, you may need to spread the changes inside the `4.8`, `5.0`, `5.1`, and `5.2` directories.
5. Commit together related changes in 1 only commit, instead of making 1 commit with the same change in each file.
6. Push your fixes to your fork.
7. Open a pull request from your fork to the `sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation` repo. Make sure to reference the relevant issue number.
